The Great Old One Cthulhu has shattered your soul.
Each piece can only see a part of the creepy hell you are locked in…
Will you be able to join your soul back together and escape?

Shattered Souls is a first person puzzle game.
You can move your character with WASD, the keyboard arrows, or your gamepad.
Interact with items using E, Space, Enter, or any gamepad face button.

Each piece of your soul is tied to the others, so every action you make happens in all screens.
If a piece of your soul is blocked by a wall, none will be able to move forward.

In each level, your first goal is to reach the statue of Chtulhu.
After you've proven yourself to the Great Old One, glyphs will appear in the level.
Align them in the center of each of the screens to escape the level, and get a little closer to escaping hell.
